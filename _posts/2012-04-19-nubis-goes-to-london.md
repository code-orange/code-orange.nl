<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After the success of the Facebook page TEDxAmsterdam, Nubis Online Marketing is proud to present Tedx GoodenoughCollege Timeline page.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: medium;">TEDx GoodenoughCollege combines the unique format and beauty of TED with the ingenuity and reach of the post-graduate community of Goodenough College.The result is an inspiring, interactive conference designed to engage its participants and promote the exchange of ideas worth spreading focusing on the Future of Humanity, providing the ‘Big Picture’. The event will take place on the 5<sup>th</sup> of May 2012 in London.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Nubis Online Marketing has assisted into the online promotion of the event through the strategic formulation and implementation of an attractive Facebook Timeline page supported with the creation of a special app.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Our team of programmers and designers gave it their best to create an esthetic page combine the TED design with the new Facebook Timeline principles. Through the special GoodenoughCollege app we built, visitors can gather all relevant information about the event and have the chance to watch the Livesteam. The application has a menu with ten tabs. </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">We present you our favorite tabs: </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tedxgoodenoughcollege/app_394414977235939?app_data=eyJwYWdlIjoiVGVhbSJ9" target="_blank">Team tab </a></strong></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">The quality and the creativity of our programmers can rise from this tab. Visitors can learn about the group of people who give life to Tedx GoodenoughCollege by shuffling their pictures though an animation procedure. Every time the shuffle button is pushed, a new profile page randomly appears after the animate mix of all the team members pictures. </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tedxgoodenoughcollege/app_394414977235939?app_data=eyJwYWdlIjoiVmlkZW8ifQ==" target="_blank">Video tab</a></strong> </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">A good example of our Design techniques. For the Tedx project we created a puzzle of videos from last year speeches. Visitor can select a video and watch it through a pop-up frame inside facebook. </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">This Project is a first attempt for Nubis Online Marketing to get inside the UK market and explore the possibilities for International collaborations. May our collaboration with Tedx GoodenoughCollege be the first destination of a great journey.  </span>
